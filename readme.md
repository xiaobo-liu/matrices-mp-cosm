# Collection of matrices for testing the matrix cosine.

`matrices-mp-cosm` is a collection of MATLAB functions that generates the selected matrices for testing the matrix cosine in multiprecision environment, these matrices are used in the paper:

Awad H. Al-Mohy, Nicholas J. Higham and Xiaobo Liu. [Arbitrary precision algorithms for computing the matrix cosine and its FrÃ©chet derivative](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/21M1441043). SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 43(1):233-256, 2022.

All 34 matrices are square and have a fixed size, ranging from 2-by-2 to 20-by-20. Most of them are taken from the matrix exponential literature, and are real, ill conditioned or rank deficient.


## Directory structure

- `anymatrix_expm.m` in the root directory links Anymatrix to the scripts inside the /private folder.
- `private/` contains the 34 matrix-generating functions, along with
- `am_properties.m`, wchich lists properties of these matrices, and
- `Contents.m`, which provides the full reference of the matrices.


## Anymatrix integration

MATLAB 2020b or newer is required for the use of Anymatrix.

To include this collection as a group in the [Anymatrix](https://github.com/mmikaitis/anymatrix) collection, please download the repository and **rename** the directory from *matrices-mp-cosm* to *mpcosm* and then **remove** the `LICENSE` and `README` files therein (as they will prevent Anymatrix to find the collection). 
Finally, put the *mpcosm* directory at the *root directory* of Anymatrix and run

```
>> anymatrix scan
```

to force a scan of the file system that will include the new group. 
The new collection shall be ready to use. For more details, see
